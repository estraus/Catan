Hello all!

catantimer.py is inspired by a variation of Settlers of Catan that my friends and I played in West Jordan, UT during a month-long ski trip in early 2022.
We set up the game as normal, but every 10 minutes we rotated clockwise, taking over the gameplay of the person to our left. 
While playing, we realized that 10 minute intervals allowed for strategy -- running out the clock, strategic trading, etc. So I randomized it to make the game less strategic/more chaotic.


catanroller.py is just a dice rolling simulator that gives a bar chart of roll frequency at the end of the game. I'm planning to improve it by having actual pictures of dice with a GUI, but that's a project for another day.
